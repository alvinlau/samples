# Code samples
Some code samples from some previosu take-home tests from interviews, and also some tiny projects I worked on at my own time

`lucky.rb` is my solution for ['being lucky' dice game](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/FgGUHXdbKi2f4vJ5m1qgM8Xr)

`xerobean.rb` connects to Xero acconting, logs in via OAuth using Selenium to confirm in browser, then downloads sample accoutn data
there is also the `Dockerfile` for running it in Docker


# Mini projects

I had these projects I was working on previously in-between jobs
They pretty stayed work-in-progress, but still good for me to play with Ruby Grape for API and Slim for templates

meshie is topic board where the content are links about the topic, I just wrote the backend API before I left it off

cardinold lets you create links that contain multiple links, sort of like a multi-link-bin compared to pastebin for text
